matchthecity-android
====================

Android app that makes use of the data from the (MatchTheCity)[https://github.com/CodeTheCity/matchthecity] project that was created at part of [CodeTheCity Aberdeen 2014](http://codethecity.org)

The purpose of the project is to provide information about various public reoccurring activities in the Aberdeen area.

In order to get the app to run correctly you will need to add your own Google Maps API key in a resouces file e.g.

    <resources>
        <string name="google_maps_key_instructions"><!--

        TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

        Follow the steps in the documentation.
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start

        A key looks something like "AIzaSyAhpLN7hAwBfFGjKcSe75MMjYWU7rvLwNw".

        Once you have your key, replace the "google_maps_key" string in this file.
        --></string>
        <string name="google_maps_key">MY_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY</string>
    </resources>
